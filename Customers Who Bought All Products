Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customer table:
+-------------+-------------+
| customer_id | product_key |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 5           |

| product_key |
+-------------+
| 5           |
| 6           |
+-------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: 
The customers who bought all the products (5 and 6) are customers with IDs 1 and 3.



Summary :

1. Table Overview: You are given two tables: "Customer" and "Product."

      "Customer" table has two columns:
            customer_id (integer): The ID of the customer (not unique in this table).
            product_key (integer): The key of the product bought by the customer (foreign key to the "Product" table).
      "Product" table has one column:
            product_key (integer): The key of the product (primary key).

2. Objective: The task is to write an SQL query that reports the customer IDs from the "Customer" table that bought all the products in the "Product" table. In other words, you need to find the customers who have bought all the products listed in the "Product" table.

3. Finding Customers Who Bought All Products: To achieve this, you should find the customers from the "Customer" table who have bought all the distinct products listed in the "Product" table. If a customer has purchased all the products in the "Product" table, it means they have bought all the unique products available.

4. Output Format: The output should be a result table with one column:

      customer_id (integer): The IDs of the customers who have bought all the products listed in the "Product" table.



Solutions :

1. Using Having

SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(DISTINCT product_key) = (
    SELECT SUM(product_key)
    FROM Product
); 

2. Using Concat

WITH t AS (
    SELECT customer_id, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product_key ORDER BY product_key) AS pkc
    FROM Customer
    GROUP BY customer_id
)

SELECT t.customer_id
FROM t
WHERE t.pkc IN (SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(product_key ORDER BY product_key) FROM Product)
