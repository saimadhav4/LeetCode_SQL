Summary :

1. We have a table called "Employee" that contains information about employees. Each row represents an employee and includes their ID, name, salary, and the ID of their manager.

2. The goal is to write an SQL query that finds the employees who earn more than their managers. We need to compare the salary of each employee with the salary of their corresponding manager.

3. The result table should contain a single column named "Employee" and include the names of the employees who earn more than their managers.

4. The order of the output doesn't matter, so we can return the result table in any order.


Soltuions :

1.

SELECT a.name AS "Employee"
FROM Employee a, Employee b
WHERE a.managerId = b.id
and a.salary > b.salary

2.

SELECT e1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e1, Employee e2
WHERE e1.managerId = e2.id AND e1.salary > e2.salary;

3. Using inner join

Select e.Name as Employee 
from Employee as e 
inner join Employee as m 
on e.ManagerId = m.Id where e.Salary > m.Salary
