1965. Employees With Missing Information (https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-with-missing-information/?envType=list&envId=e97a9e5m)

Table: Employees

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
 

Table: Salaries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the salary of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
 

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:

The employee's name is missing, or
The employee's salary is missing.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | name     |
+-------------+----------+
| 2           | Crew     |
| 4           | Haven    |
| 5           | Kristian |
+-------------+----------+
Salaries table:
+-------------+--------+
| employee_id | salary |
+-------------+--------+
| 5           | 76071  |
| 1           | 22517  |
| 4           | 63539  |
+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 2           |
+-------------+
Explanation: 
Employees 1, 2, 4, and 5 are working at this company.
The name of employee 1 is missing.
The salary of employee 2 is missing.

Summary :

1. We have two tables: Employees and Salaries.

      a. The Employees table has two columns: employee_id (primary key) and name.
      b. The Salaries table also has two columns: employee_id (primary key) and salary.

2. The goal is to write an SQL query that reports the IDs of employees with missing information.

      a. An employee's information is considered missing if either their name is missing or their salary is missing.

3. The result table should be ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

4. To solve this, we need to compare the employee IDs in both tables and identify the employees with missing information.


Solutions :

1. Using NOT IN

SELECT employee_id FROM Employees e 
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Salaries)
UNION 
SELECT employee_id FROM Salaries s 
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Employees)
ORDER BY employee_id;


2. Using IS NULL

SELECT e.employee_id
    FROM Employees e
    LEFT JOIN Salaries s
    using(employee_id)
    WHERE salary IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT s.employee_id
    FROM Employees e
    RIGHT JOIN Salaries s
    using(employee_id)
    WHERE name IS NULL
ORDER BY employee_id;
