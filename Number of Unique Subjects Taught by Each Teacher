Table: Teacher

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| teacher_id  | int  |
| subject_id  | int  |
| dept_id     | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, (subject_id, dept_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table indicates that the teacher with teacher_id teaches the subject subject_id in the department dept_id.
 

Calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is shown in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Teacher table:
+------------+------------+---------+
| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
+------------+------------+---------+
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |

Explanation: 
Teacher 1:

  - They teach subject 3 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 4 in department 1.


Summary :

1. Table Overview: You are given a table called "Teacher" with three columns:

      teacher_id (integer): The ID of the teacher (not unique in this table).
      subject_id (integer): The ID of the subject the teacher teaches.
      dept_id (integer): The ID of the department where the teacher teaches the subject.

2. Objective: The task is to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university. For each teacher, you need to count how many different subjects they teach, regardless of the department.

3. Finding Unique Subjects for Each Teacher: To achieve this, you should count the number of unique subject IDs associated with each teacher in the "Teacher" table. If a teacher teaches the same subject in multiple departments, it should still be counted as a single unique subject.

4. Output Format: The output should be a result table with two columns:

      teacher_id (integer): The ID of the teacher.
      cnt (integer): The count of unique subjects that teacher teaches.


Solutions :

1. 
SELECT teacher_id,  count(distinct subject_id) as cnt 
FROM teacher 
GROUP BY teacher_id;

2. 
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM (
    SELECT teacher_id, subject_id
    FROM Teacher
    GROUP BY teacher_id, subject_id
) as Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id
