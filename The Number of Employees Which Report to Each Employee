1731. The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee (https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-employees-which-report-to-each-employee/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)


Table: Employees

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| reports_to  | int      |
| age         | int      |
+-------------+----------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null). 
 

For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write an SQL query to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
Output: 
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
Explanation: Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is (41+36)/2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding it to the nearest integer.


Summary :

1. Table Overview: You are given a table called "Employees" with four columns:

      employee_id (integer): The ID of the employee (primary key).
      name (varchar): The name of the employee.
      reports_to (integer): The ID of the manager to whom the employee reports. It is null if the employee does not report to anyone.
      age (integer): The age of the employee.

2. Objective: The task is to write an SQL query that reports information about all managers in the company. A manager is an employee who has at least one other employee reporting directly to them.

3. Finding Managers' Information: To achieve this, you need to find all the managers, and for each manager, you should report the following information:

      employee_id (integer): The ID of the manager.
      name (varchar): The name of the manager.
      reports_count (integer): The number of employees who report directly to this manager.
      average_age (integer): The average age of the employees who report directly to this manager, rounded to the nearest integer.

4. Output Format: The output should be a result table with four columns:

      employee_id (integer): The ID of the manager.
      name (varchar): The name of the manager.
      reports_count (integer): The number of employees who report directly to this manager.
      average_age (integer): The average age of the employees who report directly to this manager, rounded to the nearest integer.


Solutions :

1. 

SELECT 
  e1.employee_id, 
  e1.name, 
  COUNT(e2.reports_to) AS reports_count, 
  ROUND(AVG(e2.age)) AS average_age 
FROM Employees e1 JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.employee_id = e2.reports_to
GROUP BY e2.reports_to
ORDER BY e1.employee_id;


2. 

SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, r.reports_count, ROUND(r.average_age) AS average_age
FROM Employees e
JOIN (
  SELECT reports_to, COUNT(*) AS reports_count, AVG(age) AS average_age
  FROM Employees
  WHERE reports_to IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY reports_to
) r ON e.employee_id = r.reports_to
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
