1873. Calculate Special Bonus (https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-special-bonus/?envType=list&envId=e97a9e5m)

Table: Employees

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
 

Calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+--------+
| employee_id | name    | salary |
+-------------+---------+--------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |
+-------------+---------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+-------+
| employee_id | bonus |
+-------------+-------+
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |
+-------------+-------+
Explanation: 
The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even employee_id.
The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'.
The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.


Summary :

1. We have a table called Employees with three columns: employee_id, name, and salary. The employee_id column is the primary key of the table.

2. Each row in this table represents an employee and includes their employee ID, name, and salary.

3. The goal is to calculate the bonus for each employee based on certain conditions.

4. The bonus calculation rule is as follows: If the employee ID is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M', the bonus is 100% of their salary. Otherwise, the bonus is 0.

5. To solve this, we need to write an SQL query that selects the employee_id column and calculates the bonus based on the given conditions.

6. The result table should be ordered by the employee_id column.


Solutions :

1. 

SELECT employee_id , salary * ( employee_id%2 ) * ( name NOT LIKE 'M%') AS bonus
    FROM employees
    ORDER BY employee_id;


2. Using Case

SELECT employee_id , 
   CASE WHEN employee_id%2 <>0 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%' THEN salary 
   ELSE 0
   END AS bonus
   FROM employees
   ORDER BY employee_id;


3. Using Union

SELECT employee_id, salary AS 'bonus'
FROM Employees
WHERE employee_id % 2 = 1 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%'
UNION
SELECT employee_id, 0 AS 'bonus'
FROM Employees
WHERE employee_id % 2 = 0 OR name LIKE 'M%'
ORDER BY employee_id
