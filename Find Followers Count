1729. Find Followers Count (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-followers-count/?envType=list&envId=e97a9e5m)

Table: Followers

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| follower_id | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user_id, follower_id) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the IDs of a user and a follower in a social media app where the follower follows the user.
 

Write an SQL query that will, for each user, return the number of followers.

Return the result table ordered by user_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Followers table:
+---------+-------------+
| user_id | follower_id |
+---------+-------------+
| 0       | 1           |
| 1       | 0           |
| 2       | 0           |
| 2       | 1           |
+---------+-------------+
Output: 
+---------+----------------+
| user_id | followers_count|
+---------+----------------+
| 0       | 1              |
| 1       | 1              |
| 2       | 2              |
+---------+----------------+
Explanation: 
The followers of 0 are {1}
The followers of 1 are {0}
The followers of 2 are {0,1}


Summary :

1. We have a table called Followers with two columns: user_id and follower_id. Each row represents a follower following a user in a social media app. The combination of user_id and follower_id is the primary key of the table.

2. The goal is to write an SQL query that returns the number of followers for each user.

3. To solve this, we need to group the rows by user_id and count the number of distinct follower_id's within each group. This will give us the count of followers for each user.

4. Finally, we need to return the result table with columns user_id and followers_count. The table should be sorted in ascending order based on user_id.


Solutions :

1. 

SELECT DISTINCT user_id, COUNT(*) AS followers_count
FROM Followers
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY user_id ASC;

2. Without Group By

SELECT DISTINCT user_id, COUNT(*) 
OVER(PARTITION BY user_id 
ORDER BY user_id) followers_count
FROM Followers
