570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports (https://leetcode.com/problems/managers-with-at-least-5-direct-reports/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)


Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Find the managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| 101 | John  | A          | None      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| John |

Summary :

1. We have a table called "Employee" with columns: id, name, department, and managerId.

      a. Each row represents an employee in the company.
      b. The id column is the primary key of the table, uniquely identifying each employee.
      c. The name column stores the name of the employee.
      d. The department column indicates the department in which the employee works.
      e. The managerId column contains the id of the employee's manager. If managerId is null, it means the employee does not have a manager.

2. The goal is to find the managers who have at least five direct reports.

      a. A direct report is an employee who has a manager and reports directly to them.
      b. We need to identify the managers who have at least five employees reporting to them directly.

3. The output should be a result table with a single column: name.

      a. The name column represents the names of the managers with at least five direct reports.
      b. The result table can be in any order.


Solutions :

SELECT m.name
FROM employee AS e
INNER JOIN employee AS m
ON e.managerId=m.id
GROUP BY e.managerId 
HAVING COUNT(e.id)>=5
