1907. Count Salary Categories (https://leetcode.com/problems/count-salary-categories/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

Table: Accounts

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, account_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
 

Calculate the number of bank accounts of each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Accounts table:
+------------+--------+
| account_id | income |
+------------+--------+
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |
+------------+--------+
Output: 
+----------------+----------------+
| category       | accounts_count |
+----------------+----------------+
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
+----------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
Low Salary: Account 2.
Average Salary: No accounts.
High Salary: Accounts 3, 6, and 8.


Summary :

1. Table Overview: You are given a table named "Accounts" that contains information about monthly incomes for different bank accounts. The table has the following columns:

      account_id (integer): The unique ID of each bank account.
      income (integer): The monthly income for each bank account.

2. Salary Categories: The task is to calculate the number of bank accounts falling into different salary categories. The salary categories are defined as follows:

      "Low Salary": All incomes strictly less than $20,000.
      "Average Salary": All incomes in the inclusive range of $20,000 to $50,000.
      "High Salary": All incomes strictly greater than $50,000.

3. Counting Accounts: Your goal is to count the number of bank accounts that fall into each of these salary categories. You need to examine the income column for each account 
and determine which category it belongs to based on the income value.

4. Output Format: The output of the SQL query should be a result table that contains three rows, each representing a salary category. The columns should be labeled as "category" 
and "accounts_count," where "category" contains the name of the salary category, and "accounts_count" contains the count of bank accounts that belong to that category. If there 
are no accounts in a particular category, the count for that category should be 0.


Solutions :

1. Using Union

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT "Low Salary" as category,
Count(income) as accounts_count
FROM Accounts
WHERE income < 20000

UNION

SELECT "Average Salary" as category,
Count(income) as accounts_count
FROM Accounts
WHERE income >= 20000 && income <= 50000

UNION

SELECT "High Salary" as category,
Count(income) as accounts_count
FROM Accounts
WHERE income > 50000;

2. Using Union All and Left Join

SELECT
    c.category
    , COUNT(a.income) AS accounts_count
FROM
    (
        SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category
        UNION ALL
        SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category
        UNION ALL
        SELECT 'High Salary' AS category
    ) c
LEFT JOIN
    accounts a ON (
        (c.category = 'Low Salary' AND a.income < 20000) OR
        (c.category = 'Average Salary' AND a.income >= 20000 AND a.income <= 50000) OR
        (c.category = 'High Salary' AND a.income > 50000)
    )
GROUP BY
    c.category
