1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products (https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/?envType=list&envId=e97a9e5m)

Table: Products

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, product_id is the primary key for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
 

Find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.


Summary :

1. We have a table called Products with three columns: product_id, low_fats, and recyclable. The product_id column is the primary key of the table.

2. The table contains information about various products. The low_fats column is an ENUM type that represents whether a product is low fat or not. It can have values 'Y' (indicating low fat) or 'N' (indicating not low fat). The recyclable column is also an ENUM type that represents whether a product is recyclable or not. It can have values 'Y' (indicating recyclable) or 'N' (indicating not recyclable).

3. The goal is to find the product_ids of the products that are both low fat and recyclable. In other words, we need to identify the products that have 'Y' in both the low_fats and recyclable columns.

4. To solve this, we can query the table and filter the rows where both low_fats and recyclable columns have a value of 'Y'.

5. Finally, we need to return the result table with the product_ids of the products that meet the above condition. The table can be ordered in any order.


Solutions :

SELECT product_id  
FROM Products 
WHERE low_fats='Y' && recyclable='Y';
