182. Duplicate Emails(https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-emails/?envType=list&envId=e97a9e5m)

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.


Summary :

1. We have a table called "Person" that contains information about individuals. Each row represents a person and includes an ID and an email.

2. The goal is to write an SQL query that reports all the duplicate emails found in the "Person" table. We need to identify the emails that appear more than once.

3. The result table should contain a single column named "Email" and include the duplicate email addresses.

4. The order of the output doesn't matter, so we can return the result table in any order.

Solutions :

1. 

SELECT DISTINCT(p1.email) from 
Person p1 JOIN Person p2 ON
p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id <> p2.id;

2.

SELECT email as Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING count(*) > 1

3.

SELECT DISTINCT(p1.email) from Person p1, Person p2
where p1.id <> p2.id AND p1.email = p2.email;
