1075. Project Employees I (https://leetcode.com/problems/project-employees-i/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

Table: Project

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id.
 

Table: Employee

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table. It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50




Summary :

Step 1: Understand the Tables

      We have two tables: "Project" and "Employee."
      "Project" table contains information about which employee is working on which project, with columns "project_id" and "employee_id."
      "Employee" table contains information about each employee, with columns "employee_id," "name," and "experience_years."

Step 2: Define the Average Experience Years

      The average experience years for a project is calculated as the sum of experience_years of all employees working on that project divided by the total number of employees working on that project.

Step 3: Calculate the Average Experience Years
To find the average experience years for each project:

      We need to match the "employee_id" in both tables to get the relevant information.
      For each project, calculate the sum of "experience_years" for all employees working on that project.
      Calculate the total number of employees working on that project.
      Divide the sum of experience years by the total number of employees to get the average experience years.
      Round the average experience years to two decimal places.

Step 4: Formulate the SQL Query
Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project:

      Join the "Project" and "Employee" tables based on the "employee_id" column.
      Group the results by "project_id."
      Use aggregate functions like SUM and COUNT to calculate the sum of experience years and the total number of employees for each project.
      Calculate the average experience years for each project using the above values.
      Round the average experience years to two decimal places.
    Select the "project_id" and "average_years" columns in the final result.


Solutions :

1. Using JOIN

SELECT
    project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM
    Project p
JOIN
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY
    project_id;


2. Using INNER JOIN

SELECT
    project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM
    Project p
INNER JOIN
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY
    project_id;
