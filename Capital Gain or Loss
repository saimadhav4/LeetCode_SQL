1393. Capital Gain/Loss (https://leetcode.com/problems/capital-gainloss/?envType=list&envId=e97a9e5m)

Table: Stocks

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| stock_name    | varchar |
| operation     | enum    |
| operation_day | int     |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(stock_name, operation_day) is the primary key for this table.
The operation column is an ENUM of type ('Sell', 'Buy')
Each row of this table indicates that the stock which has stock_name had an operation on the day operation_day with the price.
It is guaranteed that each 'Sell' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Buy' operation in a previous day. It is also guaranteed that each 'Buy' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Sell' operation in an upcoming day.
 

Write an SQL query to report the Capital gain/loss for each stock.

The Capital gain/loss of a stock is the total gain or loss after buying and selling the stock one or many times.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Stocks table:
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| stock_name    | operation | operation_day | price  |
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
| Leetcode      | Buy       | 1             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 2             | 10     |
| Leetcode      | Sell      | 5             | 9000   |
| Handbags      | Buy       | 17            | 30000  |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 3             | 1010   |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 4             | 1000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 5             | 500    |
| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 6             | 1000   |
| Handbags      | Sell      | 29            | 7000   |
| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 10            | 10000  |
+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+
Output: 
+---------------+-------------------+
| stock_name    | capital_gain_loss |
+---------------+-------------------+
| Corona Masks  | 9500              |
| Leetcode      | 8000              |
| Handbags      | -23000            |
+---------------+-------------------+
Explanation: 
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.


Summary :

1. We have a table called Stocks that contains information about stock operations. Each row represents an operation for a specific stock on a specific day. The columns in the table are stock_name (name of the stock), operation (type of operation, either 'Buy' or 'Sell'), operation_day (day of the operation), and price (price of the stock at that operation).

2. The goal is to calculate the capital gain or loss for each stock. The capital gain/loss is the total gain or loss obtained from buying and selling the stock one or multiple times.

3. It is guaranteed that every 'Sell' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Buy' operation on a previous day, and every 'Buy' operation has a corresponding 'Sell' operation on an upcoming day.

4. To calculate the capital gain/loss for each stock, we need to consider the 'Buy' and 'Sell' operations for each stock separately. For each 'Buy' operation, we need to find the corresponding 'Sell' operation and calculate the difference in prices. The capital gain/loss for a stock is the sum of the gains or losses from all the 'Buy' and 'Sell' operations.

5. The result table should have two columns: stock_name (name of the stock) and capital_gain_loss (the calculated capital gain or loss for that stock).



Solutions :

1. Using CASE

SELECT 
    summed.stock_name,
    SUM(summed.price) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM (
    SELECT 
        stock_name,
        CASE
            WHEN operation = 'Buy' THEN -price
            WHEN operation = 'Sell' THEN price
        END as price
    FROM Stocks
) AS summed
GROUP BY summed.stock_name


2. Using Case in different approach

SELECT stock_name, SUM(
    CASE
        WHEN operation = 'Buy' THEN -price
        WHEN operation = 'Sell' THEN price
    END
) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name;


3. Using IF

SELECT stock_name,
    SUM(IF(operation='Buy',-(price),(price))) AS capital_gain_loss 
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name
