1789. Primary Department for Each Employee (https://leetcode.com/problems/primary-department-for-each-employee/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

Table: Employee

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   |  Type   |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.
 

Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.

Write an SQL query to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| employee_id | department_id |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |

Explanation: 
- The Primary department for employee 1 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 2 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 3 is 3.
- The Primary department for employee 4 is 3.


Summary :

1. Table Overview: You are given a table called "Employee" with three columns:

      employee_id (integer): The ID of the employee.
      department_id (integer): The ID of the department to which the employee belongs.
      primary_flag (varchar): An ENUM with possible values 'Y' or 'N'. If the flag is 'Y', it means the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', it means the department is not the primary.

2. Objective: The task is to write an SQL query that reports the primary department for each employee. If an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column will be 'N'.

3. Primary Department: An employee can belong to multiple departments, but they need to decide which department is their primary department. The primary department for an employee is marked with 'Y' in the primary_flag column. If an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column will be 'N'.

4. Output Format: The output should be a result table with two columns:

      employee_id (integer): The ID of the employee.
      department_id (integer): The ID of the primary department for that employee.


Solutions :

1. Using Union

SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
GROUP BY employee_id
UNION
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING count(*) = 1

2. Using Distinct

SELECT DISTINCT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE employee_id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY employee_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
  )
  OR primary_flag = 'Y'
ORDER BY employee_id;


3. Using JOINs

SSELECT E.employee_id, E.department_id 
FROM Employee as E LEFT JOIN 
(SELECT employee_id, count(*) as cnt 
FROM Employee  
GROUP BY employee_id) as D 
ON E.employee_id= D.employee_id 
WHERE (D.cnt>1 AND E.primary_flag='Y') OR D.cnt=1;
