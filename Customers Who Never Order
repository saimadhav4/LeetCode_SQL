Summary :

1. We have two tables: "Customers" and "Orders." The "Customers" table contains information about customers, including their ID and name. The "Orders" table contains information about customer orders, including the order ID and the corresponding customer ID.

2. The goal is to write an SQL query that finds all the customers who have never placed any orders. In other words, we need to identify the customers who don't have any entries in the "Orders" table.

3. The result table should contain a single column named "Customers" and include the names of the customers who have never placed any orders.

4. The order of the output doesn't matter, so we can return the result table in any order.

Solutions :

1. Using Joins

SELECT c.name as Customers
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customerid
WHERE o.customerid IS NULL

2. Using Iterartive 

SELECT name as Customers
FROM Customers 
WHERE id not in (select customerId from Orders);
